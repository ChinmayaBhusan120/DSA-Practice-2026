# Two Pointer Pattern

## 📌 What is Two Pointer?

Two Pointer technique uses two indices to traverse an array or string 
from different directions to reduce time complexity.

---

## 🧠 When To Use

- Sorted arrays
- Palindrome checking
- Pair sum problems
- Removing duplicates
- Reverse operations

---

## ⏱ Time Complexity
Usually O(n)

---

## 📂 Problems Covered

1. Valid Palindrome
2. Two Sum II
3. Container With Most Water
4. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

---

## 🚀 Approach Summary

- Initialize two pointers:
  - left = 0
  - right = n - 1
- Move pointers based on condition
- Stop when they meet

---

## 🎯 Why Important?

Very common in:
- FAANG interviews
- Product companies
- Coding rounds
